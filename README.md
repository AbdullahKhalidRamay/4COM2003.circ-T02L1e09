You are given a design board with two input pins, a 6-bit pin A and
 a 6-bit pin B and one 6-bit output pin R.
 Build a circuit that asserts the absolute value A B on R. You will
 need a 6-bit 2-to-1 multiplexer for your solution, which you will have
 to build by yourself, since the use of the Plexer library is prohibited for
 this exercise. You may, however, take the 6-bit adder or subtractor from
 Logisimâ€™s Arithmetic library to save you time, but remember that you
 have already built one earlier. It is always a good idea to reuse your own
 components since you know exactly how they work.
